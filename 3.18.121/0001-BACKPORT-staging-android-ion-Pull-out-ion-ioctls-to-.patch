Subject: [PATCH 1/2] BACKPORT: staging: android: ion: Pull out ion ioctls to a
 separate file

commit b1fa6d8acb50c8e90f50fb262e5d4b7d478592bf upstream.

The number of Ion ioctls may continue to grow along with necessary
validation. Pull it out into a separate file for easier management
and review.
